## Building a proper portfolio

### Introduction

Job hunting as a software professional can become overwhelming. Between finding
roles where a candidate may find alignment, tracking applications, researching
companies, cover-letter writing, and organizing interview feedback, the process
often feels like a full-time job itself.

To complicate things, many developers(like myself) have developed a lot of
skills that don't have a proper outlet for demonstration.

This series will focus on building a proper portfolio that showcases the skills
required.

### Goals

#### Digitally assisted development tooling

Where practical, AI technologies enhance development productivity.

Tools to Explore:

- [Spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
- [Claude Code Project Management](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm)

#### Skills demonstration

- Delivery Automation Expertise: Showcase ability to design and implement robust
  CI/CD pipelines using `GitOps` best practices
- Maintenance and Scalability: illustrate best practices in writing maintainable
  and scalable code
- Infrastructure as Code: Highlight skills in using IaC tools to manage cloud
  infrastructure
- Developer Experience: Highlight drive to create tools and solutions that
  enhance developer productivity and satisfaction
- Open Source Contribution: Build and contribute to open source projects that
  solve real-world problems

#### Finding the right job

Using automation to streamline the job search process itself:

- Job Search Automation: Develop scripts or tools to automate job searching,
  application submissions, and tracking.
- Interview Preparation: Create a system to organize and review common
- Cover Letter and Resume Customization: Use AI to tailor application materials
  for specific roles and companies.

### Solution

#### 1. Open source software delivery platform

A comprehensive platform that automates the entire software delivery lifecycle.
It will include features such as:

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
- Automated testing frameworks
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates for cloud deployments
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Extensibility model for cloud-agnosticism

#### 2. A job seeking automation toolkit

- Job Requisition Tracker: A tool to automate collection of job postings from
  leading platforms and track application statuses.
- Resume and Cover Letter Generator: An AI-powered tool to customize resumes and
  cover letters for specific
